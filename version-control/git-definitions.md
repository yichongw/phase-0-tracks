# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the management of changes to programs, documents, information. It allows to creat changes in different versions, and later the revisions can be compared, restored, and merged.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branch gives you a copy of the project to work on, while the others can work on the copy of the project at the same time (in parallel). It's the duplication of an object under revision control, so the modifications can happen in parallel along both branches. Can later merge the different branches onto the parent branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is a meaningful message of what you did. A good commit message should include the action, and on which file this action is taken.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when trying to make changes to the file, but that file is deleted. Or when people make different changes to the same line of the same file.
